# Known Bugs

## FE6
 - Perceval's weapons should have been stronger. They were E rank
 - Narcian's weapon should have been stronger. It was E/D rank
    - This seems to be a recurring pattern :(
 - The Master Seal help screen is cut off. More specifically:
    - It shows up as:
        Use this item to promo
        unpromoted class Lv.

## FE7
 - Chapter 6, Rath's battle animation in the opening could not continue:
    - Workaround: Once starting the chapter, skip the entire opening
 - Chapter 21 Hector, Ninian was a Fighter yet was weilding a bow
    - Not sure what to do here. This happened because Ninian inherits Nils's weapons
    - Maybe could initially give Nils a weapon for him and Ninian, but that would make for some spaghetti code.

## FE8
 - At the beginning of Chapter 5x Valter was not randomized
 - Game froze when Selena left on chapter 10 (Ephraim)
    - Workaround: Press "Start" to skip through the cutscenes
 - Game freezes after killing Demon King
 - Game froze at beginning of chapter 9 (Eirika)
    - Workaround: Press "start" to skip through the cutscenes
