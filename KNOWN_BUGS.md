# Known Bugs

## FE6
 - None at the moment :)

## FE7
 - Chapter 6, Rath's battle animation in the opening could not continue:
    - Workaround: Once starting the chapter, skip the entire opening
 - Chapter 21 Hector, Ninian was a Fighter yet was weilding a bow
    - Not sure what to do here. This happened because Ninian inherits Nils's weapons
    - Maybe could initially give Nils a weapon for him and Ninian, but that would make for some spaghetti code.

## FE8
 - Game freezes after killing Demon King
