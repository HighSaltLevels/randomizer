# Strange Behavior

The following list contains noteable different behavior due to changes made by this randomizer.

 - When accepting the prompt to automatically class change Eirika and Ephraim, it forced them into their new class along with keeping the weapon level of their current item.
 - When Eliwood or Hector change class during a story event for their respective routes, if they're already promoted, they will change class to the corresponding unpromoted class.
 - Selection for the "Four Fanged Offense" map is the sum of levels of lord characters (not classes) being greater than or equal to 50. Class changing does not add 20 to this counter.
 - Some classes like `King`, `Fomortiis`, and `Magic Seal` have really low stats because their class stat bonuses are large. I'm considering bumping the stats of those classes.
 - Recruitment conditions for Karla are the same except Bartre can be any level 5 promoted class. It doesn't have to be warrior.
 - The Summon ability only works on specific characters and not just the class. This means only Ewan and Knoll can sumon.
